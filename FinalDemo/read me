This repostitory contains all of the code used to accomplish the tasks for FINAL DEMO which are:

Spin the robot until the marker is detected. When the marker is detected, send the angle to the arduino for the robot to move to. The robot will then move 

Display whether an aruco marker is detected on an LCD and display the angle between the camera and the detected marker

Attached below is a breif descption of each file

"ArduinoTest1" Main arduino code used to finish the tests. "Demo2python" Main demo 2 code for python to run on the pi "Moving And Grooving V2" Updated code for the demo 1 code "StateMachineBeta" state machine beta that roughly outlined the state machines used for the demo.
