This repostitory contains all of the code used to accomplish the tasks for FINAL DEMO which are:

Spin the robot until the marker is detected. When the marker is detected, send the angle to the arduino for the robot to move to. The robot will then move back to it's orginal location and repeat untill all markers are found.

Heavily optimized code for demo 2, which is used for a better score in this final demo.
