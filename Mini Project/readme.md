This folder contains all of the code used to accomplish the tasks for the mini project which are as follows:

1) Use Open CV to implement Aruco Marker Detection and return the quadrent that detected marker is in.

2) Use a motor driver to spin a motor under the control of an Arduino

3) Use an Arduino to read the rotary encoder on the motor

4) Set Up communiaction between the Raspberry Pi runing the Aruco Detection, the Arduino running and reading the motor, and a LCD screen

5) Arduino code to runa step response experiment

6) Arduino Code for a PI controller
