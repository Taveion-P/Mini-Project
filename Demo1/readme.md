This repostitory contains all of the code used to accopmlish the tasks for DEMO 1 which are:

1) Be able to move forward a specefied amount

2) Be able to rotate a specified amount

3) Display whether an aruco marker is detected on an LCD and display the angle between the camera and the detected marker

Attached below is a breif descption of each file

"2 motor movement": experimental code to move both motors
"90 degree movement": code to turn the robot 90 degrees
"Move10Feet": code to move 10 feet
"MovingandGrooving": code to move a specifeid angle and distance
"Python Code": code to controll LCD and aruco detection
"movementWithDerivativeControl": code to move a specifed distance with added derivative contoller
"rotateRobotDerivaitveControl": mode to rotate the rotate the robot with added derivative contorller
