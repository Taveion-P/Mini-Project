This repostitory contains all of the code used to accomplish the tasks for DEMO 2 which are:

Spin the robot until the marker is detected.
When the marker is detected, send the angle to the arduino for the robot to move to.


Display whether an aruco marker is detected on an LCD and display the angle between the camera and the detected marker

Attached below is a breif descption of each file

"2 motor movement": experimental code to move both motors

"90 degree movement": code to turn the robot 90 degrees

"Move10Feet": code to move 10 feet

"MovingandGrooving": code to move a specifeid angle and distance

"Python Code": code to controll LCD and aruco detection

"movementWithDerivativeControl": code to move a specifed distance with added derivative contoller

"rotateRobotDerivaitveControl": mode to rotate the rotate the robot with added derivative contorller
